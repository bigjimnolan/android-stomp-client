android-stomp-client
====================

This is barebones STOMP client with SSL

I created it to communicate with an ActiveMQ server via andoid devices.  When I made this, there were no simple solutions available.  If you have any quuestions or concersns, please write me at jiim@electroopticalvisions.com

Thanks,

Jim Nolan
